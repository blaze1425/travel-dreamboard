## 1. Executive Summary  
This project, **LMS Portal**, was developed as part of the Hack Culprit Virtual Internship.  
The goal was to build a **browser-based Learning Management System** that simulates a real-world platform for online learning, using only **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** with **LocalStorage** for persistence.  

The system supports **two roles** — *Instructor* and *Student*. Instructors can create courses and assignments, while students can enroll, submit tasks, and view grades.

## 2. Problem Statement
